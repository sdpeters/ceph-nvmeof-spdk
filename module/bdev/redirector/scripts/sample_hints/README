A few example property (properties-*.json) and hint (hint-*.json) files are
included here, from three different RBD images on a 3-node Ceph cluster.

The *rbd-test-image0.json files are for an image in the default rbd pool. The
*rbd2-test-image0.json files are for an image in an alternate OSD pool on that
cluster named rbd2. The *rbd2-ns2-test-image0.json files are for an image in
the namespace named ns2 in the pool named rbd2. Namespace here means the RBD
image namespace, which is unrelated to NVMe namespaces.

These property and hint files will not work on any other Ceph cluster. They're
included here to show you what they shold look like, and how pool and namespace
names in the imagespec affect the contents of the hint file.
